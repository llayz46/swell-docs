## Customizing Swell's interface

Swell comes with a clean, modern and consistent interface, ready to use. 
However, the design and structure remain entirely modular. 
Whether to adapt the appearance to your brand or adjust layouts to your application's needs.

Thanks to a clear structure, reusable components, a configurable CSS theme and a layout system, 
you can quickly make **Swell** a project in your image.

## Changing the logo

To change the **Swell** logo, there are two files to modify:

```tsx title="resources/js/components/app-logo.tsx"
import AppLogoIcon from './app-logo-icon';

export default function AppLogo() {
    return (
        <>
            <div className="flex aspect-square size-8 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-sidebar-primary text-sidebar-primary-foreground">
                <AppLogoIcon className="size-5 fill-current text-white dark:text-black" />
            </div>
            <div className="ml-1 grid flex-1 text-left text-sm">
                <span className="mb-0.5 truncate leading-tight font-semibold capitalize">Swell</span>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

```tsx title="resources/js/components/app-logo-icon.tsx"
import { SVGAttributes } from 'react';

export default function AppLogoIcon(props: SVGAttributes<SVGElement>) {
    return (
        <svg {...props} viewBox="0 0 32 52" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
            <path d="M7.56904 35.889L27.3808 19.5641L32 15.7579L31.9886 0L0 26.3577L7.56904 35.889Z"/>
            <path d="M14.6136 44.7606L23.7235 37.2539L27.3808 34.2402V19.5641L7.56904 35.889L14.6136 44.7606Z" fillOpacity="0.8"/>
            <path d="M20.3644 52L23.7235 49.2318V37.2539L14.6136 44.7606L20.3644 52Z" fillOpacity="0.6"/>
        </svg>
    );
}
```

- `AppLogo.tsx`: Contains the complete version of the logo, composed of the icon and your project name.
- `AppLogoIcon.tsx`: Contains only the icon <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(svg)</span> of the logo.

<Callout>
    These two files prefixed with `App`, are used to display the logo in the authenticated pages of the application.
</Callout>

## Changing the theme

**Swell** uses Tailwind and Shadcn UI to offer a polished interface. 
The integrated theme system allows you to quickly modify the global appearance, whether for light or dark mode.

To modify the default colors or adapt the theme to your project, go to the `resources/css/app.css` file.
This file contains the definition of the main CSS variables:

- `:root`: Contains CSS variables for light mode.
- `.dark`: Contains CSS variables for dark mode.

This is where you can customize colors, border-radius, spacing, etc.

<span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>
    *These variables are used throughout all application components to ensure visual consistency.*
</span>

<Callout>
    You can go further by consulting:
    - The [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) documentation on themes to understand how customization works via Tailwind.
    - The [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) documentation to easily adapt your components to your brand style.

## Modifying layouts

**Swell** relies on a **layout** system allowing you to structure the display and easily customize 
the appearance of different application pages: public pages, dashboard, authentication pages, etc.

Each layout is a React/TSX component located in `resources/js/layouts`. They define the global structure 
of pages (header, sidebar, container) and can be modified or replaced according to your needs.

Here's an overview of the layout organization:

<Files>
  <Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="js" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="layouts" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="app">
          <File name="app-header-layout.tsx" />
          <File name="app-sidebar-layout.tsx" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="auth">
          <File name="auth-card-layout.tsx" />
          <File name="auth-simple-layout.tsx" />
          <File name="auth-split-layout.tsx" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="settings">
          <File name="layout.tsx" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="admin-layout.tsx" />
        <File name="app-layout.tsx" />
        <File name="auth-layout.tsx" />
        <File name="base-layout.tsx" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Using a layout

To use a layout in a page, wrap the page content in the desired layout.

```tsx title="login.tsx"
import { Head } from '@inertiajs/react';
import AuthLayout from '@/layouts/auth-layout';

export default function Login() {
    return (
        <AuthLayout title="Login" description="Login to your account">
            <Head title="Login" />
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen">
                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Login</h1>
            </div>
        </AuthLayout>
    )
}
```
<Callout>
    Swell uses different layouts according to page types (authentication, administration, etc.) 
    to maintain a clear and reusable structure.
</Callout>

### Creating a layout

Creating a custom layout allows you to adapt the interface to specific needs
<span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(e.g.: layout with sidebar, card layout, etc.)</span>.

To create a layout:

1. Create a file in the `resources/js/layouts` folder or in a subfolder (e.g. `auth`, `app`, `settings`).
2. Export a React function that receives `children` (and possibly other props like `title`, `description` or `breadcrumbs`).
3. Integrate the desired structure: header, sidebar, container, etc.

```tsx title="resources/js/layouts/custom-layout.tsx"
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

type Props = {
    children: ReactNode;
    title?: string;
};

export default function CustomLayout({ children, title }: Props) {
    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen bg-muted text-foreground">
            <header className="p-4 bg-background border-b">
                <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">{title ?? 'Custom page'}</h1>
            </header>
            <main className="p-6">{children}</main>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Once your layout is created, you can import and use it as seen in the previous section.

<Callout>
    Don't hesitate to draw inspiration from existing layouts *(auth-layout.tsx, app-sidebar-layout.tsx, etc.)* 
    to understand their structure and maintain a clear and consistent organization in your project.

    You can also reuse or adapt them according to the specific needs of your interfaces.

    For more info, see the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#starter-kit-customization) documentation.

## Modifying components

**Swell** includes a wide variety of reusable components located in the `resources/js/components` folder. 
These components cover frequent interface needs such as:

- `pagination-component.tsx`

- `confirm-delete-dialog.tsx`

- `toaster-wrapper.tsx`

- `product-card.tsx`

To better structure the project, components provided by **Swell** are organized in a dedicated subfolder:
`resources/js/components/swell`. This allows you to clearly distinguish them from components specific to your project, 
which can remain at the root of `components`.

These components can be freely modified or extended to meet your project's needs.

    Swell's goal is to provide a solid but flexible foundation. Each component is designed to be easily understandable, reusable, and customizable.
