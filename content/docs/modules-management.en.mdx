## Module management: activate or remove features

**Swell** adopts a modular approach to enrich your application: 
each additional feature is offered as an optional module, ready to be activated, customized or removed according to your needs.

This modularity allows you to adapt **Swell** to your project, without unnecessary overhead or dependency on features you don't need.

### Activating a module

To add a new feature, simply activate the corresponding module. 
Modules are located in the `app/Modules/` folder and accessible via dedicated artisan commands.

For example, to activate the "Wishlist" module:

Modify your environment file `.env` to indicate to Swell that the feature should be available. 

```bash
SWELL_WISHLIST_ENABLED=true
```

Then, clear the configuration cache:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
php artisan swell:enable wishlist
```

This command publishes the necessary files (controllers, models, migrationsâ€¦) and makes the feature immediately available in your application.

    Each module is independent: you can activate several, deactivate them or customize them without impacting Swell's core.

### Customizing a module

Each module is customizable, you can adapt its components, views or configuration to your business needs. 

Don't hesitate to modify these files to adjust the behavior or appearance of the feature.

### Deactivating or removing a module

If a feature is no longer useful to you, delete the associated migrations as well as the published files and deactivate it in your `.env` file.

    **Swell** gives you total control over your application's features. Activate only what you need, for a lightweight, clear foundation perfectly adapted to your project.
