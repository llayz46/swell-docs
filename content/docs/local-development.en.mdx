## Running Swell locally

To run **Swell** locally, use the following command:

```bash
composer run dev
```

This command groups the following commands:

- `php artisan serve`: Starts the Laravel development server.
- `php artisan queue:listen`: Starts the queue manager for background tasks.
- `npm run dev`: Compiles front-end assets with Vite.
- `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8000/stripe/webhook`: Listens for Stripe events and redirects them to the Swell API.

To customize the command, you can modify the `dev` script in the `composer.json` file:

```json title="composer.json"
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": [
            "Composer\\Config::disableProcessTimeout",
            "npx concurrently -c \"#93c5fd,#c4b5fd,#fdba74,#86efac\" \"php artisan serve\" \"php artisan queue:listen\" \"npm run dev\" \"stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8000/stripe/webhook\" --names='server,queue,vite,stripe'"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Compile assets for production

Once you're ready to deploy **Swell**, start by compiling your frontend assets with:

```bash tab="npm"
npm run build
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm run build
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn build
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun run build
```

## Optimize Laravel for production

Then, optimize your Laravel application for the production environment:

```bash
php artisan optimize
```

This command caches configuration, events, routes and views, which speeds up application loading time.

    Remember to run this command every time you deploy or modify the production configuration.
