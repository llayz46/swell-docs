## A modern technological foundation

**Swell** relies on a set of robust and recognized technologies to offer a smooth,
performant and scalable development experience. Each technological choice aims to simplify the creation of e-commerce applications while guaranteeing quality, security and maintainability.

### Laravel 12

**Swell** naturally relies on **Laravel 12** as its main foundation, taking advantage of its latest features and 
rich ecosystem to offer a modern, reliable and flexible development environment.

<Callout>
    All Swell features are designed to make the most of Laravel's strengths, while remaining simple to customize according to your needs.

### Inertia.js

The choice of **Inertia.js** (associated with React) was obvious because it opens up more possibilities in terms of architecture and frontend ecosystem, 
compared to solutions like **Livewire** which remain very Laravel-centered. 

Inertia allows you to fully benefit from the power of **React** while maintaining the simplicity of the Laravel backend: 
your routes directly return React pages, without the complexity of a REST API to maintain.

### React

**React** is the JavaScript library that powers **Swell**'s user interface. 
It allows you to create dynamic, reactive and modular interfaces, while favoring component reuse and code maintainability.

### Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS** offers a utility class system to quickly style your interfaces. 
It allows you to design modern, responsive and consistent designs, while keeping total control over the appearance of each component.

### shadcn/ui

**shadcn/ui** offers a collection of reusable and customizable UI components, perfectly integrated with Tailwind CSS. 
They accelerate the creation of elegant and accessible interfaces, while remaining adaptable to your project's visual identity.

### Stripe

**Stripe** is the payment solution integrated into **Swell** via the Laravel/Cashier package.
It allows you to manage transactions securely, with simple integration and advanced features (payments, subscriptions, refundsâ€¦).

### Pest

**Pest** is the PHP testing framework used in **Swell**. 
It offers an expressive and modern syntax for writing unit and functional tests, guaranteeing code stability and quality throughout project evolution.

<Callout>
    **Swell** favors proven and documented technologies, so you can focus on creating
    business value, without worrying about the technical stack.
