## Organizing business logic with Actions & Modules

Swell adopts a flexible approach to organize business logic and optional features.
Two complementary concepts are offered: **Actions** and **Modules**.


### Actions

**Actions** constitute a central pattern in **Swell** to organize your business logic. 
They allow you to isolate precise operations 
<span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(creation, update, deletion, specific processing)</span>
in dedicated classes located in `app/Actions/`.

This approach facilitates reuse, unit testing, and keeps your controllers lightweight 
and focused on request handling. You are free to adapt this organization according to your preferences, 
Swell imposes no constraints.

For example, you can organize your actions around a feature:

```php title="handleAddProductToCart.php"
class HandleAddProductToCart
{
    public function __invoke($productId, $quantity = 1, $cart = null)
    {
        $product = Product::findOrFail($productId);
    
        if ($product->isOutOfStock()) {
            throw new \Exception('Product out of stock.');
        }
    
        ($cart ?: CartFactory::make())->items()->firstOrCreate([
            'product_id' => $productId,
        ], [
            'quantity' => 0,
        ])->increment('quantity', $quantity);
    
        CartCache::forget();
    }
}
```

Or centralize multiple features in a single Action class:

```php title="handleProductCart.php"
class HandleProductCart
{
    public function add($productId, $quantity = 1, $cart = null)
    {
        // Logic to add
    }

    public function remove($productId, $cart = null)
    {
        // Logic to remove
    }
}
```

    Swell imposes no style: you are free to adopt the structure that best fits your project or your team.

### Modules 

Modules correspond to parts of the application that you can activate, modify or remove according to your needs. 
They group independent and optional features that **Swell** allows you to publish 
via artisan commands <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(config, views, assetsâ€¦)</span>.

This logic favors a modular approach to the project, while leaving you the freedom to customize each module as you wish.
