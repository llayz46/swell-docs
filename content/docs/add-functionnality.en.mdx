## Adding a new feature to Swell

Here are some suggestions for adding a feature in **Swell**: the modular and 
pragmatic approach inspired by Laravel standards and starter-kit best practices is recommended, 
but it is possible to choose the implementation most suited to the project.

## General best practices

- **Modularity**: Isolate each new feature in its own module or folder.
- **Convention**: Respect the existing structure (Actions, Models, Controllers, Tests…).
- **Readability**: Favor clear, documented and typed code.
- **Tests**: Add unit and functional tests to ensure stability.
- **Reusability**: Use Swell's shared helpers, traits and services.

## Recommended approach

1. **Create models and migrations**  
   Use `php artisan make:model Name -m` to generate the model and associated migration.  
   This is a classic Laravel project: it is therefore possible to use the standard structure (`app/Models/`, `database/migrations/`) or organize features in the `Modules/` folder if needed.

2. **Develop actions**  
   Place business logic in action classes (`app/Actions/`).  
   Example: `AddToWishlistAction`, `ApplyCouponAction`.

        The structure follows that of a classic Laravel project: see the [architecture](/architecture) page for more details.  
        (Also see the [actions-modules](/actions-modules) page to go deeper.)
   </Callout>

3. **Update controllers**  
   Add or adapt controllers.

4. **Adapt the front-end**  
   If needed, create or modify React components in `resources/js/`.  
   It is recommended to use existing components as reference to avoid code duplication.

5. **Write tests**  
   Add tests in `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` to cover the new logic and ensure feature stability.

### Example: Adding a "Favorites" (Wishlist) feature

#### 1. Generate the model and migration

```bash
php artisan make:model Wishlist -m
```

In the migration, define the necessary fields (user_id, product_id…).

#### 2. Create the business action

In `app/Actions/Wishlist/AddToWishlistAction.php`:

```php
namespace App\Actions\Wishlist;

use App\Models\Wishlist;

class AddToWishlistAction
{
    public function execute($user, $product)
    {
        return Wishlist::firstOrCreate([
            'user_id' => $user->id,
            'product_id' => $product->id,
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Update the controller

In `app/Http/Controllers/WishlistController.php`:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $action = new AddToWishlistAction();
    $action->execute($request->user(), $request->product);
    return response()->json(['success' => true]);
}
```

#### 4. Adapt the front-end

Create a component to list favorites.

#### 5. Test

Add tests in `tests/Feature/WishlistTest.php`.

    For more complex features, it is advisable to draw inspiration from existing modules (e.g.: Cart, Comments).

    By following this approach, the consistency, maintainability and scalability of the Swell project are ensured.
