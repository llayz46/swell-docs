## Seeders in Swell

Seeders allow you to automatically add essential or test data to the database. 
**Swell** provides several seeders to facilitate installation, development and testing of your application.

## Initialize roles with RoleSeeder

The `RoleSeeder` allows you to automatically add essential roles to the database during installation or application development.

**Swell** relies on the [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission) package for role and permission management. This robust package facilitates the creation, assignment and management of roles in Laravel.

### Why use a role seeder?

- **Time saving**: no need to manually create roles for each new installation.
- **Consistency**: all environments have the same base roles.
- **Automation**: facilitates deployments and testing.

<Callout>
    Use the RoleSeeder to ensure that roles like `admin`, `customer` or `visitor` always exist in the database. These roles are created via the spatie/laravel-permission package.
</Callout>

### Execution example

To initialize the base roles, simply run the following command:

```bash tab="Seeder"
php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder
```

```bash tab="Fresh"
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --seeder=RoleSeeder
```

After execution, the following roles will be created:

- `admin`: full access to Admin pages.
- `customer`: groups users who have placed orders.
- `visitor`: basic user, who has not yet placed an order.

<Callout title="Good to know">
    Adapt the RoleSeeder content according to your application's specific needs.
    
    For more info on permission management, see the [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission) documentation
</Callout>

## Initialize development data with LocalSeeder

The `LocalSeeder` is designed to facilitate local development by injecting test data into the database: users, products, categories, etc. It allows you to simulate a realistic environment without having to manually create each entry.

### Execution example

```bash tab="Seeder"
php artisan db:seed --class=LocalSeeder
```

```bash tab="Fresh"
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --seeder=LocalSeeder
```

This seeder will create a set of varied data so you can test the application under conditions close to production.

<Callout>
    The `LocalSeeder` should only be used in development environment.
</Callout>

## Generate test products with LocalProductSeeder

The `LocalProductSeeder` allows you to quickly generate a catalog of fictitious products to test Swell's e-commerce features (listing, search, cart, etc.).

### Execution example

```bash tab="Seeder"
php artisan db:seed --class=LocalProductSeeder
```

```bash tab="Fresh"
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --seeder=LocalProductSeeder
```

After execution, several test products will be available in the shop, with varied prices, stocks and descriptions.

<Callout>
    The `LocalProductSeeder`, called by the `LocalSeeder`, centralizes the generation of realistic test products to simulate a real catalog without weighing down the `LocalSeeder`.
</Callout>

## Tips and best practices

- Run seeders adapted to your environment: `RoleSeeder` for the base and `LocalSeeder` for development.
- Never use development seeders (`LocalSeeder`) in production.
- Customize seeder content according to your project's specific needs.
