## Installing Swell

You can install **Swell** in two ways: either with the Laravel Installer tool, or directly via Composer.

```bash tab="Laravel Installer"
laravel new project-name --using=swell/starter-kit
```

```bash tab="Composer"
composer create-project swell/starter-kit project-name
```

These commands will:
- Download the latest version of Laravel
- Install the Swell starter-kit and its dependencies
- Pre-configure the project for modern e-commerce usage

## Environment configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Generate the application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
3. Configure your database connection in `.env`.

       For any questions regarding service configuration like Algolia or Stripe, refer to the official [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs) documentation.
   </Callout>

## Install front-end dependencies

```bash tab="npm"
npm install
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn install
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun install
```

## Initialize the database

Run the base migrations and seeders
for the development environment with test data:

```bash
php artisan migrate

php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder

php artisan db:seed --class=LocalSeeder
```

Or, if you prefer, you can use the following command:

```bash
php artisan swell:install
```

## Launch the project locally

To start the development server:

```bash
composer run dev
```

This command launches:
- The Laravel server
- The Vite watcher for the front-end
- The queue listener
- Stripe webhook listener (if configured)

Then access [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Log into the application

After installation, the LocalSeeder will automatically create an administrator user.  
The default credentials are:

- **Email**: john@doe.com
- **Password**: password

<Callout>
    You can modify the account information directly in the `LocalSeeder`. See the documentation on [seeders](/seeders).
