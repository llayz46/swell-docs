## Create a user via CLI

**Swell** provides a dedicated artisan command to quickly create a user with a chosen role from the terminal. 
This is particularly useful during the installation phase or to test features requiring an account.

### Using the command

Run the following command from your project's CLI:

```bash
php artisan swell:make-user
```

This command guides you through several questions:

- **Role** (visitor, customer, admin)
- **Email address** of the user
- **Password** (masked input)
- **Name** of the user

<Callout>
    By default, the password is encrypted and the user is immediately active.
</Callout>

### Execution example

```bash
php artisan swell:make-user

Role (visitor/customer/admin): admin
Email address: admin@example.com
Password: ********
Name: Martin Dupont

User created successfully!
```

### Advanced options

You can also pass certain parameters directly in the command:

```bash
php artisan swell:make-user --email=admin@example.com --password=secret --name='Martin Dupont' --role=admin
```

This allows automating user creation, for example in installation scripts.
