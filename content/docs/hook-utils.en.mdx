# Custom utility hooks

In **Swell**, several custom React hooks are provided to simplify state management,
user preferences or business logic on the frontend. These hooks encapsulate recurring behaviors
and facilitate code reuse in your components.

## List of main hooks

| Hook            | Description                                                                                | Context required?       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `useInitials`   | Generates initials from a first/last name, useful for user avatars.                       | No                      |
| `useAppearance` | Manages theme (light/dark/system) and user choice persistence.                            | No                      |
| `useCart`       | Allows access to cart, add/remove items, and track cart state.                            | Yes (`CartContext`)     |
| `useWishlist`   | Allows managing user wishlist (add, remove, retrieve).                                    | Yes (`WishlistContext`) |

<Callout>
    Some hooks need to be used inside their associated context provider (e.g.: `CartProvider`, `WishlistProvider`, etc.).
</Callout>

## Usage examples

### Get user initials

```ts
import { useInitials } from "@/hooks/use-initials";
import type { SharedData } from "@/types";
import { usePage } from "@inertiajs/react";

const { auth } = usePage<SharedData>().props;
const initials = useInitials(auth.user.name); // "JD"
```

### Manage appearance theme

```ts
import { useAppearance } from "@/hooks/use-appearance";

const { theme, setTheme } = useAppearance();

// To switch to dark mode:
setTheme("dark");
```

### Use cart (with mandatory context)

```ts
import { useCartContext } from '@/contexts/cart-context';
// Warning: this hook must be used inside <CartProvider>

const { addToCart } = useCartContext();
const PRODUCT = {...};
addToCart({ product: PRODUCT, quantity: 2 });
```

<Callout>
    Swell is entirely wrapped in the `CartProvider`. Thus, all child components can use cart-related hooks without additional configuration.
</Callout>

## Why use these hooks?

-   **Logic centralization**: Business or UI logic is factorized and testable.
-   **Reusability**: Hooks are usable in any component (provided they are in the right provider).
-   **Readability**: Component code remains simple and readable.

<Callout>
    For more examples or to create your own hooks, draw inspiration from the structure of existing hooks in the
    `resources/js/hooks/` folder.
