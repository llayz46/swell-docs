description: The organization of key folders in Swell.

## Application folder structure

Swell is based on Laravel and its MVC architecture to facilitate project adoption, 
customization, and project extension. Each folder has a well-defined responsibility
and can be adapted according to your needs.

## Main folders

### `app/`

Contains the server-side Laravel logic: controllers, requests, middlewares, etc. 
**Swell** adds a lightweight structure around administration controllers 
<span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(Http/Controllers/Admin)</span> notably.
Without imposing a rigid architecture.

We also find folders like **Factories**, used to centralize certain reusable business logic, 
contributing to maintaining a clear and modular organization.

### `resources/js/`

All frontend code is organized here, with a structure designed for readability and maintainability:

- `pages/`: Inertia pages, classified by feature 
<span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(admin/products/, brands/, etc.)</span>.
- `components/`: Swell groups its native components in `components/swell/`.
- `layouts/`: global or section-specific layouts
<span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(auth-layout, admin-layout, etc.)</span>.
- `hooks/`, `context/`: reusable logic specific to the interface or user behavior, 
integrated into certain components or pages.
- `lib/`, `utils/`: utility functions or modules. Swell relies on these folders to centralize 
certain recurring logic, without imposing structure on you.
- `types/`: global project types. The `index.d.ts` file allows sharing types to maintain consistency between front-end and back-end.

    Swell provides this structure to get started quickly, but it remains freely adjustable according to your needs or development style.

This organization allows clarity and freedom in frontend development, while facilitating project evolution.

### `routes/`

Laravel routes are organized to reflect the functional domains of the application:

- `admin.php`: routes related to the administration interface.
- `web.php`: public routes.

#### Compartmentalizing your routes

For better organization, create new route files in the `routes/` folder according to your functional needs.
Then import these files in `web.php` via require or require_once to keep a single and clear entry point for your routes.

    This organization is optional but recommended to facilitate maintenance and evolution of routes, 
    especially in complex or modular projects.
