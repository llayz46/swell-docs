## About Swell

**Swell** is built on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, a modern and robust PHP platform, and relies on
[Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) as well as [React](https://reactjs.org) to offer a dynamic and smooth user experience.
It was originally designed as a complete e-commerce application, then redesigned as a **modular starter kit**.

The goal is to provide a functional and structured foundation to allow any developer to quickly start
a custom application, without sacrificing quality, maintainability or performance.

<Callout>
    Swell is also a project in constant progress. It doesn't claim to be the best Laravel starter kit, nor to offer the most perfect code. The goal is above all to offer a solid, scalable and pragmatic foundation, while remaining accessible and pleasant to use.
